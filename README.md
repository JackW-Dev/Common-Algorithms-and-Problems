# Common-Algorithms-and-Problems

This repo will contain commonly requested algorithms and coding problems for coding interviews.

I will be using this as an opportunity to practice my owen implementation skills and to improve my coding ability.
It is my hope that others may utilise the code to aid with their own understanding too.

All code will be fully commented to explain what is occurring to aid with this educational task.
I intend on producing multiple implementations for each algorithm/ concept in different languages over time.

The table below is a reflection of what is currently implemented and in which languages.

| Category | Algorithm/ Concept | Languages currently implemented |
| -------- | ------------------ | ------------------------------- |
| Sorting | Bubble sort | C, Python, Java, Kotlin |
| Sorting | Insertion sort | C, Python, Java, Kotlin |
| Sorting | Merge sort | Python, Java, Kotlin |
| Searching | Linear search | C, Python, Java, Kotlin |
| Searching | Binary search | C, Python, Java, Kotlin |
| Data structures | Linked list | C, Python |
| Data structures | Stack (Array and Linked List) | C |
| Data structures | Queue (Array and Linked List) | C, Python |
